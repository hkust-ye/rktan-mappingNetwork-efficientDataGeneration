# rktan-mappingNetwork-efficientDataGeneration

The codes are provided as appendix for the article entitled:
## An efficient data generation method for ANN-based surrogate models 
The provided codes includes:
1. Architecture for networks used in the code
2. The TO beso code implemented with Property Network

Due to the limitation of uploads, the dataset provided are only samples of the data used for the training of networks throughout the manuscript, for each of the cantilever beam and L-shaped beam design problem described in the manuscript.
